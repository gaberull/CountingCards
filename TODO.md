## Ideas

- Maybe add in words with a few microseconds delay for a hand won that spread across the console
- Sad face on loss, maybe in a box like the winnings
- try to make winnings boxes similar in size, using num of digits of win size and offsetting w/ spaces or lack thereof on opposite end of print statement
- Require bets to be in $5 increments
- Clear console sometimes to make it cleaner
