## TODO:

- [ ] Handle error where putting too many funds 
- [ ] Implement rules - 'r' in action()
- [ ] Implement change in basic strategy and info for adjusting betting patterns based on true count (the ratio)
- [ ] Handle input of capital letters everywhere where a char is input from stdin
- [x] Make hashmaps static for Card class
- [ ] Add ability for user to play multiple hands
- [ ] Add table limits (betting) and maybe allow player to select them

## Ideas

- Maybe add in words with a few microseconds delay for a hand won that spread across the console
- Sad face on loss, maybe in a box like the winnings
- try to make winnings boxes similar in size, using num of digits of win size and offsetting w/ spaces or lack thereof on opposite end of print statement
- Require bets to be in $5 increments
